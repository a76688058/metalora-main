# NEW4-4D — Workshop private Seoul GCS media storage

Status: **ACCEPTED — SIGNED REGIONAL DELIVERY PROVEN** (NEW4-4D-2A, 2026-10-07). Ready for NEW4-4D-3.
The app still uses Supabase Storage for Workshop images. No cutover and no Supabase mutation yet. Two least-privilege findings remain owner decisions (see "Open items").

## Decision

Workshop customer images (originals and previews) will move from the public Supabase `workshop` bucket (Cloudflare global CDN) to a private Google Cloud Storage bucket in Seoul. The browser reads and writes them directly with short-lived V4 signed URLs on the Seoul regional endpoint. The DB stores canonical object paths only, never URLs or signed URLs.

Owner approval (2026-10-07): bucket name, caps, bucket security, CORS, signer-SA model, IAM bindings, IAM Credentials API, env names, `@google-cloud/storage` direct dependency, and the migration direction.

## Provisioned (NEW4-4D-2)

| Bucket IAM | `roles/storage.objectUser` → signer SA; `projectOwner` legacy bucket/object owner and `projectViewer` legacy readers (GCS defaults); `projectEditor` legacy bindings **removed** (NEW4-4D-2A) |
| Signer SA IAM | `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` → `807497260135-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`, on the signer SA only |
| IAM Credentials API | already enabled before this ticket (no mutation) |
| Dependencies | `@google-cloud/storage` `^8.2.0` (installed 8.2.0); `google-auth-library` `9.15.1` exact (NEW4-4D-2A) |

Upload caps (owner): originals **25 MB** (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`); previews **5 MB** (`image/jpeg`).
Object metadata: `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
Future paths: `originals/{uid}/{uuid}.{ext}`, `previews/{uid}/{uuid}.jpg`. Smoke namespace: `_ops-smoke/` only.

Env names (not bound on Cloud Run yet; bind with the NEW4-4D-3 deploy): `WORKSHOP_GCS_BUCKET`, `WORKSHOP_GCS_ENDPOINT`, `WORKSHOP_GCS_SIGNER_SA`. Values listed in `.env.example`. No credentials in env.

## Signed delivery proof (NEW4-4D-2A)

`WORKSHOP_GCS_SMOKE_SIGNED=1 npm run verify:workshop-gcs-foundation` → FOUNDATION CONFIG 28/28 + SIGNED DELIVERY PROOF 20/20 = **48/48 PASS**. Synthetic `_ops-smoke/` objects only.

Chain: operator OAuth → IAM Credentials `signBlob` → `workshop-media-signer` → V4 signed URL → `https://storage.asia-northeast3.rep.googleapis.com/<bucket>/<object>`. Every signed URL is checked before use: host = Seoul regional, `X-Goog-Credential` = signer SA, path bound to the object, `X-Goog-Expires` = 300. Signing aborts if `storage.authClient.getCredentials().client_email` is not the signer SA.

- Signed PUT: `content-type: image/jpeg`, `cache-control: private, no-store`, `x-goog-content-length-range`, `x-goog-if-generation-match: 0` all signed → 200. Stored metadata `image/jpeg`, `private, no-store`, size 16; anonymous GET denied.
- Size: signed range `1,32` + 64-byte body → **400**, nothing stored. Client sending a wider range than signed → **403** (header is bound by the signature).
- Create-only: second signed PUT to the same object → **412**; signed GET still returns the original bytes.
- Signed GET → 200, exact bytes, `private, no-store`, no Cloudflare headers. After delete → 404.
- All synthetic objects deleted; prefix empty (soft delete 0).

Temporary operator binding lifecycle: `user:<operator>` granted `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on the signer SA only → smoke → removed in a `finally` block in the same command → read-back shows only the runtime SA. Verifier default mode asserts the operator binding is absent.

Dependency rationale: `@google-cloud/storage` 8.2.0 picks the signing identity via `instanceof Impersonated` against its own `google-auth-library`. With direct `google-auth-library@9.15.1`, `npm ls` shows storage's copy as `deduped` to the root 9.15.1, and the verifier proves `storage` and the app resolve the same module file and that storage reports the Impersonated target as signer (offline, no runtime fallback). `@google/genai` now gets its own nested `google-auth-library@10.9.1` (re-resolved from the previously hoisted 10.6.1 within genai's `^10` range), `gaxios@7.3.1`, `gcp-metadata@8.1.2`, `google-logging-utils@1.1.3`. The old `gaxios@7.1.3` → `rimraf@5`/`glob@10` chain dropped out. `@google/genai` is not imported by `src/` or `server.ts`. The future server bundle must keep a single `google-auth-library` instance for storage and the adapter; re-check with the verifier after any dependency change.

## Foundation smoke (NEW4-4D-2)

`npm run verify:workshop-gcs-foundation` → 34/34 PASS at the time (superseded by the 48-check version above; default mode now runs FOUNDATION CONFIG only).

Proven on the regional XML API path with operator OAuth (not a signed URL):

- PUT with `Content-Type: image/jpeg`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, `x-goog-content-length-range`, `x-goog-if-generation-match: 0` → 200
- GET returns identical bytes, `image/jpeg`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store`; no Cloudflare headers
- anonymous GET → denied
- `x-goog-if-generation-match: 0` on an existing object → 412 (create-only works)
- `x-goog-content-length-range: 1,32` with a 64-byte body → 400, object not stored
- CORS preflight allows `https://metalora.art`, refuses `https://www.metalora.art` and other origins
- DELETE → 204; GET after delete → 404; no `_ops-smoke/` objects remain (soft delete is 0)

## Resolved (NEW4-4D-2A)

- Signed-URL chain: proven (above).
- Impersonation identity mismatch: resolved by direct `google-auth-library@9.15.1` (deduped, verified).
- `projectEditor` legacy bindings removed from this bucket only (`legacyBucketOwner`, `legacyObjectOwner`). `projectOwner` and `projectViewer` bindings unchanged.

## Effective IAM posture (after NEW4-4D-2A)

- Signer SA: bucket `roles/storage.objectUser`; no keys.
- Signer SA TokenCreator holders: runtime SA only (resource-level). Operator: none.
- Runtime SA (project `roles/editor`, `roles/run.builder`; project has no org/folder ancestors):
  - via bucket bindings: none (it is not a basic Owner/Viewer, and `projectEditor` was removed)
  - via `roles/editor`: no `storage.objects.*`; does include `storage.buckets.delete` (empty bucket only), `storage.buckets.create/list`, HMAC key and managed-folder permissions
  - via `roles/run.builder`: **`storage.objects.get` on every project bucket, including this one** → direct read still possible without the signer. Not removed (no approval; may be needed for builds/deploys).
  - Determined from role definitions. An effective-access runtime test was not run: it would need impersonating the runtime SA (extra IAM), and Policy Troubleshooter is not enabled.

## Open items (owner decisions; do not block NEW4-4D-3 code, do block "least privilege complete")

1. **Runtime SA direct read via project `roles/run.builder`.** Options: move `run.builder` to a dedicated build SA, or replace it with a narrower role, then re-verify that deploys still work. Owner + A6 ops ticket.
2. **Pre-existing project-wide `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` for `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@metalora-auth.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.** This can sign as any project SA, including the Workshop signer. Origin and need not inspected in this ticket (key inspection was out of scope). Owner should confirm whether the Firebase Admin SDK identity is used. If it is not, remove or narrow the binding. The verifier allows only this documented exception.
3. `roles/editor` on the runtime SA can delete this bucket once it is empty. Low risk while objects exist; resolved by narrowing the runtime SA's project roles (same ticket as item 1).

## Not done (by design)

- No app cutover: Workshop upload/read code unchanged, Supabase `workshop` bucket and policies unchanged.
- No customer object read, copied, moved or deleted.
- No path migration, no NEW4-6 / NEW4-7 change, no Cloud Run env, revision, deploy or traffic change.
- Payment frozen until NEW7.

## Do not do

- Do not use `storage.googleapis.com` (global endpoint) for Workshop objects.
- Do not enable soft delete, versioning, retention, lifecycle deletion or Cloud CDN on this bucket.
- Do not add origins to CORS without a documented need.
- Do not create service-account keys.
- Do not store signed URLs anywhere, and do not log signed URLs, tokens or customer object paths.
- Do not make the Supabase `workshop` bucket private before every consumer (including protected `OrdersModal.tsx`) reads through GCS.

## Future implementation order

1. Owner decisions on the open IAM items (parallel to step 2; required before calling least privilege complete).
2. A6 NEW4-4D-3: storage adapter (GCS + Supabase legacy) wired into NEW4-6 / NEW4-7 dual-store deletion, plus sign-upload / sign-read / commit / discard endpoints. Bind env in the same deploy.
3. A0: `src/lib/workshopMedia.ts` resolver and `getFullImageUrl` handling for both legacy URLs and paths.
4. A2 / A3 / A4: display consumers (Cart, CartContext, PDP, admin) through the resolver.
5. `OrdersModal.tsx` protected-WIP handoff and migration (A3). **Cutover blocker.**
6. A6: canonical-path validation migration (RPC + triggers); A2 switches uploads to GCS.
7. Dual-store QA, legacy copy with verification, Supabase cutover (drop insert policy, make private, drop public select, delete legacy objects, wait at least the cache TTL).
8. Privacy finalization (remove CDN entry and markers), then A5 QA.

## Ownership

A6: GCS ops/IAM, adapter, server endpoints, migrations, NEW4-6/7 integration, legacy copy, Privacy. A0: resolver, `getFullImageUrl`, package approval. A2: Workshop upload, `durableHandoff`, PDP (A4 review for WebGL textures). A3: Cart, CartContext, admin consumers, `OrdersModal.tsx` after WIP handoff. A5: read-only QA.
